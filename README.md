# Vulnerability Scanning & Disclosure Report â€“ Metasploitable 2

## Overview  
This project documents the findings of a vulnerability scan conducted on **Metasploitable 2**, a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine used for ethical hacking and penetration testing practice. The scan was performed in a controlled environment to identify security weaknesses, assess their severity, and suggest appropriate remediation steps, all while adhering to a hypothetical **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)**.

## Objective  
- Conduct a comprehensive vulnerability scan on Metasploitable 2  
- Categorize and assess discovered vulnerabilities based on severity  
- Provide suggested remediation steps and security improvements  
- Simulate a responsible disclosure process using a custom VDP  

## Tools and Environment  
- **Target Machine**: Metasploitable 2 (Linux-based vulnerable VM)  
- **Scanning Tools**: [Specify here, e.g., Nmap, OpenVAS, Nessus, Nikto, etc.]  
- **Environment**: Local lab setup for ethical and legal testing  

## Why Metasploitable 2?  
Metasploitable 2 is intentionally designed to emulate real-world vulnerabilities in a safe, non-production setting. It is widely used for educational and research purposes by cybersecurity professionals and students. Testing on Metasploitable 2 poses no legal or ethical concerns.

## Key Activities  

### Vulnerability Scanning  
- Performed active scanning using selected tools  
- Identified open ports, services, outdated software, and misconfigurations  
- Collected vulnerability data and severity ratings (e.g., CVSS scores)

### Vulnerability Categorization  
- Grouped vulnerabilities by type (e.g., service misconfigurations, weak credentials, outdated services)  
- Prioritized issues based on risk level and potential impact  

### Remediation Recommendations  
- Documented detailed recommendations for each vulnerability  
- Suggested mitigations based on industry best practices and vendor guidance  

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)  
- Created a mock VDP simulating how vulnerabilities would be reported and disclosed  
- Policy outlines:
  - Scope of testing
  - How to report vulnerabilities
  - Timelines for acknowledgment and resolution
  - Legal safe harbor for ethical testing

## Learnings  
- Hands-on experience in ethical vulnerability assessment  
- Improved understanding of real-world security flaws and scanning techniques  
- Learned how to responsibly document and report vulnerabilities  
- Practiced aligning technical findings with disclosure best practices  

## Disclaimer  
This project was conducted on a deliberately vulnerable machine in an isolated lab environment for **educational purposes only**. All scans and exploits were performed legally and ethically in accordance with responsible disclosure practices.
